- Profiles are outdated
- Teams rely on personal networks and MS Teams pings

# Why This Matters

<v-clicks>

- Outdated skills data is worse than missing data
- Staffing decisions based on guesswork
- Expertise stays invisible
- Teams bypass Workday and rely on memory
- Duplicate effort across projects

# The Insight

<v-clicks>

- The real problem is engagement, not storage
- People won't open Workday just to update skills
- They do use Microsoft Teams every day

Skill updates should be:
- Lightweight
- Conversational
- Continuous
